### Final



Sketch:

For my Sketch i chose the colour Green to represent as well as the other colours (blue, yellow and red) that were given to us. I thought that i would use a hexagonal polygon to represent the colour red as i find red a harsh colour and the hexagon is also a harsh looking shape with its sharp edges, and gives the feeling of a warning. I chose to use ellipses to represent yellow as yellow gives off a nicer bubbly feeling. I chose to represent blue by repeating waving lines using arcs to represent water. I chose to represent green by drawing triangles to represent hills and the earth.


Interpolation:

I made a diamond shape for the interpolation. The colour i chose a purple/ pink colour to work with. The first row changed the stroke weight, the second row was supposed to change the width of the diamond but for some reason i was unable to get it to work. The third row changed the fill of the diamond from black through greys to white.


Glyph:

For my original glyph i stuck with the idea of a background circle but i wanted to have a rectangle inside that would move for the brightness and change colour for the saturation. For the hue it would change the colour of the background circle. For this first glyph i based my work around the code given in the lecture so i would get a greater understanding of how the glyph system works.


Grey Glyph:

For my grey glyph, i ended up restarting so that it would be easier to distinguish in the oddball mode. I made an outer(background) circle with multiple circles in the middle in a rotation. 
Hue - Changes the size of the circle that the inner circles rotate around so they end up moving in and out together.
Saturation - Changes the stroke weight of the inner circles.
Brightness - Changes the colour(hue) of the outer background circle from black to white going though the different tones of grey.


Spot Glyph:

For my spot glyph I used the same glyph as in my grey glyph as i liked how it turned out. It also works well for the colour aspect. I have made mine use a lot of colour in the final spot glyph instead of just a small splash of colour as I like how it has turned out compared to when i tried only a small amount of colour. I put the spot colour in each section where i use colour such as the fill and stroke functions. In the oddball function i find it easier to find the odd ball now that i am using more colours as it adds an extra element to my glyph.


Final:

Added the new code to create the screensaver mode which i think is a really cool idea and helps to show off the glyphs nicely.
